Notes:


When the code is running on localhost, both recommendation methods works great! But, when the code is running on PythonAnywhere, the workday recommendation
is not working because it is making too much API calls within one second. Therefore, I have added the time.sleep(1) to slow down the process.

However, "import time" is a known bug within PyCharm as the import will not execute properly, and time.sleep() will not work. Therefore, I have only added the time.sleep()
on PythonAnywhere but not in the version that I have submitted in github (Although I have the code in there, but commented out with the word "(python BUG)."




Remarks:


There are some little details in this program. For example, it will make sure that the user has filled in all the required fields. Then, when I am using the
sunrise-sunset API, the conversion between UTC(the default return value) to the target location time, the potential offsets in date, and conversion from 12-hour to
24-hour format(required by timezone API) was also a bit challenge in order to make sure everything is working great.
